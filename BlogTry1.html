<h2>My Journey!</h2>
<h3>(What the FORK am I doing?!?)</h3>
    
<p class="quote">After moving to New York City to pursue an opera degree at Manhattan School of Music and working as their Associate Director for Alumni Engagement for the last five years, I’ve decided to leave the field and quit my job to do something completely different.</p> 

    <p>Growing up, I always loved music, but I was also good at other things. Having multiple talents and interests (humble brag?) is a blessing, of course, but it made choosing a career path at the end of high school really hard. After 13 rewarding and challenging years in the music industry (that’s a whole other story!), I am yearning for more professional growth and ready to move onto something new.</p>

    <p><strong class="hello">Software Engineering. </strong>Yes, you read that right.</p>
    
    <p>I’ve considered a career in coding for years and finally started to dabble in the basics over the last six months. However, I wasn’t able to spend enough free time exploring this path while working a full-time job. Fast forward to January 31, 2020 -- I quit. I am finally taking a chance in life and in myself. I am ready to put an idea I’ve had for years into action.</p> 
    
    <p>It was a really hard decision for me to make. Manhattan School of Music was my home. I learned so much about myself personally and professionally. Most of all, I will miss the people, but I knew it was time to move on.</p>
    
    <p>Changing career paths completely is pretty terrifying, and I am aware just how much hard work is ahead. In bocca al lupo and toi, toi, toi, Lauren!! Until I know how to add a comment field…I will be talking to myself lol.</p> 

    <p>Maybe one day, I'll be designing your website. Better yet, maybe you'll even hire me. (Wink!) Until then, I invite you to join me on my coding journey!</p>

<h2>Life During the Corona Virus</h2>

<p class="quote">Just a month ago, I had finished up a two-week tour with the <a href="https://nygasp.org/">New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players</a> and was settling back into life in New York City. Then, the corona virus migrated to the U.S. and everything changed and rapidly, at that.</p>

    <p>Stay inside. Stay home. Only leave to get groceries and other necessities, to walk you dog, or to exercise alone. Remain at least 6 feet away from anyone.</p>

    <p>All stores not deemed a necessity, are closed. All restaurants, at least the ones that are still open, are take-out and pick-up only.</p>

    <p>New York currently has half of the corona virus cases in the U.S. Lots of people fled NYC. The streets are very quiet. But not so quiet that you can walk down the street without worrying about another person getting within your 6-foot bubble.</p>

    <p>Right about now, the only thing giving me total comfort is my pup Kona. He has absolutely no idea what is going on and is thrilled my husband and I are home all day long. I look forward to when things go back to normal but until then, enjoy this photo of Kona.</p>
